_mkbook_ is my simpler alternative to [_mdbook_](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook) which is a great tool, however I really dislike some of the decisions they tookâ€”such as relying on javascript for highlighting and navigation and including a lot of bells and whistles such as javascript-based search.

This tool aims to work somewhat similarly to _mdbook_, but is generally intended to be a more minimal alternative that is customized more towards my needs and desires than anything else.

If you're not familiar with _mdbook_, _mkbook_ is a tool to convert a collection of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) files into a static website / book which can be published online. It was created to help me write documentation with minimum fuss while presenting it in an easy-to-consume manner.
