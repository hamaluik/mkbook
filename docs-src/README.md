_mkbook_ is my simpler alternative to [mdbook](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook) which is a great tool, but for which I really dislike some of the decisions they took, such as relying on javascript for highlighting and navigation, and including a lot of bells and whistles such as javascript-based search.

This tool aims to work somewhat similarly to _mdbook_, but is generally intended to be a more minimal alternative that is customized more towards my needs and desires than anything else.
