title = "Images"
---

To include an image, use the standard markdown format:

```md
![title](url)
```

This will wrap the image in a `figure` with an associated `figcaption` containing the title of the image, as so:

```md
![a bear](https://placebear.com/g/512/256 "A majestic bear")
```

will render as:

![a bear](https://placebear.com/g/512/256 "A majestic bear")
