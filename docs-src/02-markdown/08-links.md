_mkbook_ uses standard _MarkDown_ notation for links:

```md
[link text](link url)
```

Links can be separated into three types:

1. External links (prepended by `http://` or `https://`)
2. Internal links (relative path names)
3. Reference links (prepended by `ref://` and then followed by the chapter title) to refer to other chapters in the book**

**Note**: Reference links aren't implemented yet!
