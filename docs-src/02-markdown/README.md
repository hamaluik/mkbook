_mkbook_ relies pretty extensively on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for its ease of use. If you're not familiar with _Markdown_, it is a simple markup language that is design to be easy to read and write in plain text, and then (relatively) easy for a computer to convert into other formats such as HTML or LaTeX.
